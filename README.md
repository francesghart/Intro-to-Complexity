# Introduction to Complexity
This repository houses my assignments and other materials for the Santa Fe Institute's free online course, <a href=https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses/165-introduction-to-complexity>Introduction to Complexity.</a>

"In this course you'll learn about the tools used by scientists to understand complex systems. The topics you'll learn about include dynamics, chaos, fractals, information theory, self-organization, agent-based modeling, and networks. Youâ€™ll also get a sense of how these topics fit together to help explain how complexity arises and evolves in nature, society, and technology. There are no prerequisites. You don't need a science or math background to take this introductory course; it simply requires an interest in the field and the willingness to participate in a hands-on approach to the subject."
